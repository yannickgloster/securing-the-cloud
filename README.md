# Securing the Cloud

### Built for [CSU34031 Advanced Telecommunications](https://teaching.scss.tcd.ie/module/csu34031-advanced-telecommunications/)

Encrypt your files on Google Drive and share them securely!

Securing the Cloud is a secure cloud storage application which secures files stored on Google Drive. Users can log in with their Google Account. Upon login, a folder named SECURE will be created in the user's root folder of Google Drive. When a user creates a group, a folder will be in the user's SECURE folder. The user can add & remove users from these groups. Files can be uploaded and downloaded to the group. All the files are encrypted when uploaded and decrypted when downloaded. If someone were to download the file from Google Drive, they would not be able to decrypt the file.
