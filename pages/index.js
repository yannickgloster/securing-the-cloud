        Securing the Cloud is a secure cloud storage application which secures
        files stored on Google Drive. Users can log in with their Google
        Account. Upon login, a folder named SECURE will be created in the user's
        root folder of Google Drive. When a user creates a group, a folder will
        be in the user's SECURE folder. The user can add & remove users from
        these groups. Files can be uploaded and downloaded to the group. All the
        files are encrypted when uploaded and decrypted when downloaded. If
        someone were to download the file from Google Drive, they would not be
        able to decrypt the file.
